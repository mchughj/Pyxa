# Pyxa

In July I backed the kickstarter for Pyxa:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/creoqode/pyxa-diy-game-console

This was a neat little 'game console' and I loved the idea of recreating some classic games using super tight constraints.  

There doesn't appear to be a github for the developer of the console but they have quite a few example games implemented.  This repo contains all of the games (derived or otherwise) for this console.  

## Requirements

Safe to say that the pyxa requires the following libraries to operate correctly.  Not all of them may be required depending on the specifcs.
* RTTTL player.  Used for sounds.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/creoqode/pyxa-diy-game-console
* Adafruit's excellent GFX library.   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
* Adafruit's library for the display used in the Pyxa.   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library

## Building

Keep in mind that the Pyxa is essentially an _arduino nano_.
